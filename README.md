# The-Time-Series-Thinkers
A retail company wants to forecast the sales of their products for the next six months based on their historical sales data. The company has collected daily sales data for each product for the past two years.The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the sales of each product for the next six months

**Abstract**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately forecast the sales of products for the next six months based on the historical sales data collected by a retail company for the past two years. The project also seeks to identify the key factors that influence sales. The model will be developed using a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques, and will be evaluated using various metrics. The results of the project will be useful for the retail company to make informed decisions about inventory management, production planning, and resource allocation, among other things.

**Introduction**

In today's highly competitive retail industry, accurate sales forecasting plays a crucial role in strategic decision-making, inventory management, and overall business success. Time series forecasting models have been widely used in the retail industry to predict future sales trends based on historical data. In this project, we aim to develop a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA algorithm to forecast the sales of a retail company for the next six months. We will also focus on identifying the key factors that influence sales and adjust the components of the model accordingly to improve its forecasting accuracy. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a reliable and accurate sales forecast to the retail company, which will help them make informed decisions and stay ahead of their competition.
